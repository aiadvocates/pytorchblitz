Right now you're probably thinking \"let's set it to fifty million #amirite?\" The best analogy for why this is a bad idea is golf. I'm a terrible golfist (is that right?) so I don't really know anything - but pretend you are trying to sink a shot (again sorry) but can only hit the ball the same distance every time. Easy right? Hit it the exact length from where you are to the hole! Done! Now pretend you don't know where the hole is but just know the general direction. Now the distance you choose actually matters. If it is too long a distance you'll miss the hole, and then when you hit it back you'll overshoot again. If the distance is too small then it will take forever to get there but for sure you'll eventually get it in. Basically you have to guess what the right distance per shot should be and then try it out. That is basically what the learning rate does for finding the \"hole in one\" for the right parameters (ok, I'm done with the golf stuff).\n","\n","Below there are three things that make this all work:\n","1. **The Model** - this is the function we're making that takes in the digit vector and should return the right number\n","2. **The Cost Function** (sometimes called the loss function). I know I promised I was done with golf but I lied. Remember how I said in our screwy golf game you knew the general direction of the hole? The cost function tells us the distance to the hole - when it's zero we're there! In actual scientific terms, the cost function tells us how bad the model is at getting the right answer. As we take shots you should see the cost function decreasing. If this does not happen then something is wrong. At this point I would change the shot distance (or `learning_rate`) to something smaller and try again. If that doesn't work maybe change the model!\n","3. **The Optimizer** - this part is the bit that actually changes the model parameters. It has a sense for the direction we should be shooting and updates all of the internal numbers inside the model to find the best internal knobs to predict the right digits.
