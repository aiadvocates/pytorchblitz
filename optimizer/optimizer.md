# Optimizing Model ParametersÂ¶

Now that we have a model and data it's time to train, validate and test our model by optimizating it's paramerters on our data! 

To do this we need to understand a how to handle 5 core deep learning concepts in PyTorch
1. Hyperparameters (learning rates, batch sizes, epochs etc)
2. Optimization Loops
3. Loss
4. AutoGrad
5. Optimizers 

Let's dissect these concepts one by one and look at some code at the end we'll see how it all fits together.

## Hyperparameters 

Hyperparameters are adjustable parameters that let you control the model optimization process. For example, with neural networks, you can configure:

 - **Number of Epochs**- the number times iterate over the dataset to update model parameters
 - **Batch Size** - the number of samples in the dataset to evaluate before you update model parameters
 - **Cost Function** - the method used to decide how to evaluate the model on a data sample to update the model parameters
 - **Learning Rate** - how much to update models parameters at each batch/epoch set this to large and you won't update optimally if you set it to small you will learn really slowly 
 
```python
    learning_rate = 1e-3
    batch_size = 64
    epochs = 5
```

## Optimizaton Loops

Once we set our hyperparameters we can then optimize our our model with optimization loops.

The optimziation loop is comprized of three main subloops in PyTorch.

 1. The Train Loop -  Core loop iterates over all the epochs 
 2. The Validation Loop - Validate  loss after each weight parameter update and can be used to gauge hyper parameter performance and update them for the next batch. 
 3. The Test Loop - is used to evaluate our models performance after each epoch on traditional metrics to show how much our model is generalizing from the train and validation dataset to the test dataset it's never seen before.  

 ```python
    for epoch in range(num_epochs): # Optimization Loop
        # Train loop over batches
            model.train() # set model to train 
            # Model Update Code
            model.eval() # After exiting batch loop set model to eval to speed up evaluation and not track gradients (this is explained below) 
            # Validation Loop
            # - Put sample validation metric logging and hyperparameter update code here 
        # After exiting train loop set model to eval to speed up evaluation and not track gradients (this is explained below) 
        # Test Loop
             # - Put sample test metric logging and hyperparameter update code here 
 ```

## Loss 
The loss is the value used to update our parameters. To calculate the loss we make a prediction using the inputs of our given data sample. 

```python
    preds = model(inputs)
    loss = cost_function(preds, labels)
```

## AutoGrad and Optimizer (We might want to split this when we go more in depth on autograd )

By default each tensor maintains a graph of every operation applied on it unless otherwise specified using the torch.no_grad() command. 

![Autograd graph](https://discuss.pytorch.org/uploads/default/original/1X/c7e0a44b7bcebfb41315b56f8418ce37f0adbfeb.png)

PyTorch uses this graph to automatically update parameters with respect to our models loss during training. This is done with one line loss.backwards(). Once we have our gradients the optimizer is used to propgate the gradients from the backwards command to update all the parameters in our model. 

```python
    optimizer.zero_grad() # make sure previous gradients are cleared
    loss.backward() # calculates gradients with respect to loss
    optimizer.step()
```

The standard method for optimization is called Stochastic Gradient Descent, to learn more check out this awesome video by [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi). There are many different optimizers and variations of this method in PyTorch such as ADAM and RMSProp that work better for different kinds of models, they are out side the scope of this Blitz, but can check out the full list of optimizers[here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html) 

## Putting it all together lets look at a basic optimization loop

```python

#initilize optimizer and example cost function

# For loop to iterate over epoch
    # Train loop over batches 
        # Set model to train mode
        # Calculate loss using 
        # clear optimizer gradient
        # loss.backword
        # optimizer step
        # Set model to evaluate mode and start validation loop
        #calculate validation loss and update optimizer hyper parameters
    # Set model to evaluate test loop

```
